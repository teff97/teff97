Chapter 2 through page 32

Analysis Questions set 3:
1. There are only two objects because the locations are not objects but the fish are.

2. It should return an array containing objects f1 and f2.

3. The return value should be false because there is a fish at loc1.

4. The return value should be true because there is not a fish at loc3.

5. The return value should be f2 because there is a fish at loc2.

6. The return value should be null because there is not a fish at loc3.

7. No because when you initialize a fish it already has a location so when you add to the environment there is already a fish there.

8. The programmer wants the code to use the constructor not method, and each constructor is slightly different so they have a common method that each one calls.

9. Yes, except that then there would be only one environment running at a time.

Exercise set 2:
3. The program throws an error saying that there is already something there. When the fish is initialized it is initialized to a location in the environment so when the fish is added to the environment using the env.add() method it thinks that the fish is already there.

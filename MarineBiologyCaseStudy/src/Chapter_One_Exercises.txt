Chapter One Exercises
Exercise Set 1:
1. Complete (yes/no)? Yes
2. No the place that the fish move to is different but each time it moves it seems to operate off some rules.

Analysis Question Set 1:
1.The body of waster is represented by the bounded environment, which is blue. The lines represent the locations in the body of water.
2. They can be at any position that is not occupied by another fish.
3. No they each face their own direction which does not affect where they go.
4. It moves every time one space either north south east or west except for backwards. It moves randomly.

Exercise Set 2:
1.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1			(3, 2)				North				Yes				North				(2, 2)			North
	2			2, 2				North				Yes				West				2, 1			West
	3			2, 1 				West				Yes				North				1, 1			North	
	4			1, 1				North				Yes				West				1, 0			West
	5			1, 0 				West				Yes				South				2, 0			South
The fish woves in a random way either forward left or right but never backwards.

2.No we have different results. I can not confirm if there are rules that the fish follow or weather they are truely random and have not broken the rules that I have come up with.

Analysis Question Set 2:
1.Five step are not enough data to find a pattern but my classmates also noticed that the fish never moved backwards
2.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1			3, 2				North				Yes				North				2, 2			North	
	2			2, 2 				North				Yes				East				2, 3			East	
	3			2, 3 				East				Yes				South				3, 3 			South
	4			3, 3				South				Yes				East				3, 4			East
	5			3, 4 				East				Yes				South				4, 4			South
	6			4, 4				South				Yes 			South				5, 4			South
	7			5, 4 				South				Yes				South				6, 4			South
	8			6, 4				South				Yes				West				6, 3			West
	9			6, 3				West				Yes				North				5, 3			North	
	10			5, 3 				North				Yes				North				4, 3			North
	11			4, 3 				North				Yes				West				4, 2			West
	12			4, 2 				West				Yes				South				5, 2			South
	13			5, 2				South				Yes				South				6, 2			South
	14			6, 2				South				Yes				West				6, 1			West
	15			6, 1				West				Yes				West				6, 0 			West
	16			6, 0 				West				Yes				North				5, 0 			North
	17			5, 0				North				Yes				North				4, 0			North	
	18			4, 0				North				Yes				East				4, 1			East
	19			4, 1				East				Yes				East				4, 2			East
	20			4, 2				East				Yes				North				3, 2			North

Analysis Question Set 3:
1.The environment is numbered like an array where the first location is 0, 0 and the last location is 6, 4

Exercise Set 3:
1.Yes the Location of the fish in other programs are generally organized in a line of fish depending on the size of the program. 
2.When I fill up the entire graph except for one space then only one fish moves and all the other ones stay still
